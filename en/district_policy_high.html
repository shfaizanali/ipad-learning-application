            The Board of Education has approved guidelines that all students must follow when using computer systems in the Los Angeles Unified School District. These guidelines identify acceptable - or allowable - uses of the computer network and Internet, and also clarify unacceptable or inappropriate uses. These guidelines are designed to keep students safe. Remember: the use of the District computer system is a privilege not a right.
